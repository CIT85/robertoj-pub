            <h2>Social Effects of Video Games</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Positive Social Effects</h3>
                <p>Video games have been shown to have various positive social effects. They can foster teamwork and
                    cooperation among players, as many games require collaborative strategies to succeed. Additionally,
                    video games can provide opportunities for social interaction and networking, particularly in online
                    multiplayer environments where players from around the world can connect and communicate.</p>

                <h3>Negative Social Effects</h3>
                <p>On the other hand, video games have also been associated with some negative social effects. Excessive
                    gaming can lead to social isolation and withdrawal from real-life interactions, particularly if
                    individuals prioritize gaming over maintaining relationships and responsibilities. Furthermore, some
                    research suggests that exposure to violent or inappropriate content in video games can desensitize
                    individuals to real-world violence and contribute to aggressive behavior.</p>

                <p>Video games represent a multi-billion-dollar industry, generating substantial revenue from sales of
                    games, in-game purchases, subscriptions, and other revenue streams. The popularity of video games
