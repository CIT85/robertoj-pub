## My page layout 
The layout combines grid and flexbox techniques to organize content:

- **Container:** Utilizes grid layout with three equal-width columns and a 1rem gap between items.
- **Sections:** Each section has 20px padding, rounded corners, and a shadow effect.
- **Color Palette:** Positioned to span the first two columns within the container.
- **Header:** Uses flexbox for horizontal alignment with space between items and vertical centering.
- **Footer:** Utilizes flexbox to horizontally center its content.

## Media Query 
Here is a small summary of my changes throughout the media queries.
also I choose to use the bootstrap breakpoints 

**Grid Layout Adjustment:** I adjusted the grid layout to optimize how my content was shown. For smaller screens, I switched to a single-column layout for better readability, while for larger screens, I expanded to multiple columns to make better use of available space.

**Font Size Optimization:** I adjusted font sizes to maake it readable and aesthetics across different screen sizes. On smaller screens, font sizes were decreased to enhance readability, while on larger screens, they were adjusted to maintain visual balance.

**Responsive Images:** Images were made responsive to adapt through varying screen sizes. This involved setting maximum width to ensure images scale appropriately without losing clarity or distorting proportions.

**Header and Footer Border Adjustment:** To maintain visual consistency and clean aesthetics, I set the border radius of the header and footer to 0 within certain media queries. This eliminated any border appearance discrepancies across different screen sizes.
