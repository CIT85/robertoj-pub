            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>"Avatar: The Last Airbender" is an animated television series created by Michael Dante DiMartino and
                Bryan Konietzko. Set in a world where certain individuals, known as "benders," have the ability to
                control one of the four elements: Water, Earth, Fire, or Air, the show follows the journey of Aang, the
                last Airbender and the Avatar. The Avatar possess all four elements making him the only one and a new
                avatar is reborn once his/her death. Aang is tasked with restoring balance to a world torn apart by war,
                particularly with the Fire Nation seeking domination over all other nations, Aang, accompanied by
                friends Katara, Sokka, and Toph. They embark on a quest to master the elements and end the Fire Nation's
                tyranny.
                Along their journey, they encounter allies and confront formidable challenges.</p>
            <p>Fun fact: Dante and Bryan drew inspiration from various real martial arts styles when creating the
                bending techniques featured in "Avatar: The Last Airbender."</p>

            <h2>Bending</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Waterbending</h3>
                <p>Inspired by Tai Chi, a Chinese martial art known for its slow, flowing movements and focus on
                    internal energy (chi) control. </p>
                <p>Waterbending involves fluidly manipulating water in various forms, such as liquid and ice, for both
                    offense and defense. Derived from the moon and ocean, waterbenders exhibit enhanced abilities at
                    night and possess healing skills. They epitomize adaptability and resilience, embodying the fluid
                    nature and strength of their element.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Earthbending</h3>
                <p>Based on Hung Gar Kung Fu, a traditional Chinese martial art that emphasizes strong stances, powerful
                    strikes, and rooted footwork.</p>
                <p>Earth symbolizes strength, stability, and endurance. Earthbenders harness the power of the earth
                    beneath their feet, enabling them to manipulate rock, metal, and soil. They excel in defensive
                    techniques, creating barriers and using the environment to their advantage.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Firebending</h3>
                <p>Influenced by Northern Shaolin Kung Fu, an aggressive and dynamic Chinese martial art characterized
                    by rapid, explosive movements and strong attacks. </p>
                <p>Fire embodies passion, energy, and transformation. Firebenders derive their power from the sun,
                    fueling their ability to generate and control flames. They specialize in offensive maneuvers,
                    unleashing powerful attacks and rapid strikes with precision and intensity.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Airbending</h3>
                <p>Inspired by Baguazhang, a Chinese martial art focused on circular movement, evasion, and redirecting
                    an opponent's energy.</p>
                <p>Air represents freedom, spirituality, and harmony. Airbenders harness the power of the wind, allowing
                    them to manipulate air currents and create gusts of wind. They are known for their agility and
                    evasive maneuvers, focusing on redirecting energy rather than direct confrontation.</p>
